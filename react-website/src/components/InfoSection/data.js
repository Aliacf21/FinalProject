	description: "The IAT is a tool used in social psychology in order to assess people's implicit associations between concepts (Greenwald, Mcghee, & Schwartz, 1998). The IAT is performed by having participants rapidly categorize two target concepts with an attribute (e.g., the concept 'male' or 'female' with the attribute 'logical'), such that easier pairings (i.e., faster responses) are interpreted as more strongly associated in memory than more difficult pairings (i.e., slower responses) (Greenwald, Mcghee, & Schwartz, 1998).The participants performed 6 blocks of tasks (see table to the left for a description of each block) each composed of 80 trials. Participants were instructed to select either “1” or “9” depending on the target mappings. Blocks 1, 2, 4, and 5 acted as baseline measures of the participants' reaction times. Blocks 3 and 6 measured implicit attitudes by having participants categorize faces and attributes in a way that was either congruent or incongruent with gender stereotypes. The congruent block had participants categorize male faces and positive attributes together vs. female faces and negative attributes, while the incongruent block had participants categorize male faces and negative attribute together vs. the female faces and positive attributes. There were two versions of the task, which counterbalanced the order in which participants perform the congruent and incongruent block."

	description: "Many people rely on coffee in their daily lives as a stimulant. According to a study commissioned by the National Coffee Association, 64% of American adults report they drink coffee every day with an average consumption of 3.1 cups per day. While direct intake of caffeine is known to cause physiological arousal, studies show that environmental cues related to coffee also affect people’s thoughts and behaviors (Chan & Maglio, 2019). Our research sought to explore the effects of coffee cues on people’s cognitive performance. Understanding this problem allows us to learn more about enhancing performance without using caffeine or other central neural system stimuli. Our study also examined how reliance and impression of coffee can influence our performance."

export const ResearchProject_Experiment = {
	id: "Experiment",
	description: "In this study, we used a 2 (Visual cue: coffee visual cue and no cue) * 2 (Survey order: pre-task and post-task) between-subject factorial design and measure participants’ reaction time and accuracy on a repeated digit vigilance task. According to Nehlig’s study on caffeine’s effect on human cognition (Nehlig, A. 2004), among a variety of cognitive tasks, caffeine has the most significant and consistent effect on vigilance tasks. This helped us determine the effects of coffee as a visual cue on cognitive performance and how people’s expectations might serve as a mediator."

	description: "We randomly assigned 80 participants into four conditions. The coffee and pre-task survey condition (C1) had 19 participants. The coffee and post-task survey condition (C2) had 20 participants. The water and pre-task survey condition (W1) had 21 participants. The water and post-task survey condition (W2) had 20 participants. The participants completed 5 blocks in the task, with 100 trials in each block (10 positives and 90 negatives). The data collection thus produced 50 positive trials and 450 negative trials in total for each participant. No participant or trial was excluded given that all hit trials were within three standard deviations from the mean response time. We calculated the hit rate, false alarm rate, average response time for hits, d’ and beta for each participant and then compiled the data. For 7 participants with a hit rate of 1 or false alarm rate of 0, we are unable to calculate d’ and beta. We did not exclude them because most of these participants were in the coffee condition, and excluding them would have made our analysis significantly biased. Therefore for these participants, we substituted hit rate with 0.98, which was 1 - 1/(total positive trials) and false alarm rate with 0.0022, which is 1/(total negative trials). These adjusted d’ and beta values accounted for less than 10% of our total samples. "
